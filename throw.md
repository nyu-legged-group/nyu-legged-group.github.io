## Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of optimal control techniques for diverse application
scenarios being envisioned for humanoid robots. Throwing is a common human activity used in a variety of situations,
including sports, hunting, rescue, etc. Optimization approaches have previously been considered to maximize the simulated
throw performance for humans. Experimental approaches for improving human throw performance have been restricted
to observation and mimicry of high performing athletes. In the case of robotics, prior research on throw performance
improvement using optimization has been limited to simulations studies, with scant research considering experimental validation. 
To address this research gap, in this effort, we consider the optimal design, experimental implementation, and analysis
of a whole-body throwing motion in a double support humanoid robot with the use of a differential dynamic programming
(DDP) approach. We provide results from repeated experiments to demonstrate that the proposed DDP method significantly
improves the throwing performance for a 23 degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot in contrast to a previously proposed key-frame
(KF) method. With the framework of this paper, a humanoid robot can perform highly dynamic whole-body throwing tasks, achieving 
optimal throwing distance while maintaining balance stability.
