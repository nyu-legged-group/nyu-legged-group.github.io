Yet, analogous research for humanoids has received scant attention. To address this research gap, in this work, we consider the optimal design, implementation, and examination of a rollover strategy--similar to the one for humans--for  a humanoid robot by employing a differential dynamic programming (DDP) approach.","tags":null,"title":"A Rollover Strategy for Wrist Damage Reduction in a Forward Falling Humanoid","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628380800,"objectID":"35f64ff52aacd0d08cf09df8c01138c5","permalink":"https://nyu-legged-group.github.io/project/rollover/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rollover/","section":"project","summary":"A Rollover Strategy for Wrist Damage Reduction in a Forward Falling Humanoid","tags":["control","robotics"],"title":"Humanoid Rollover","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dongdong Liu","Hoon Jeong","Aoxue Wei","Vikram Kapila"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604448000,"objectID":"603daa6bc234da027d47973baf5587c2","permalink":"https://nyu-legged-group.github.io/publication/forecast/","publishdate":"2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/forecast/","section":"publication","summary":"To improve on prior works, we consider a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network, which makes use of historical measurements of system states as inputs, to effectively predict fall probability in real time.
